# Computational Genomics: Applied Comparative Genomics (EN.601.649) Final Project


### Project Title 
Evaluating cell-type clustering algorithmâ€™s robustness to technical artifacts via synthetic spatial transcriptomics data 


### Team SE Palmeiras
Jamie Moore, Rafael dos Santos Peixoto, Caleb Hallinan


### Basic Idea
We aim to evaluate the robustness of popular cell-type clustering algorithms in spatially resolved transcriptomics by simulating lateral diffusion and cell segmentation errors using synthetic and open-source data to understand their impact and potential mitigation strategies.
